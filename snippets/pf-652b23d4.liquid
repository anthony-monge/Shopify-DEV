Our ISO/IEC 17025 accredited calibration laboratory ensures the highest level of accuracy, helping your business meet stringent standards and maintain peak performance and safety. From maritime and DoD sectors to commercial industries and mission-critical data centers, our expert calibration services are designed to support a wide range of needs.<br><br>Our commitment to excellence started with the design of our new 44,500-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility in Chesapeake, VA. Collaborating with top architects, engineers, and our quality assurance team, we built this purpose-driven headquarters with accuracy and reliability at its core. This facility enables us to provide industry-leading instrument calibration services, ensuring precision and consistency across diverse sectors.<br><br>Our 5,000-square-foot accredited calibration lab [link to page] is strategically designed to minimize environmental factors, such as sunlight, that could affect measurement accuracy. The 1,000-square-foot dimensional calibration room is maintained at a precise 68 ± 5°F and monitored by an advanced environmental control system to ensure the highest measurement accuracy. Every aspect, from electrical grounding to gravitational force surveys, is engineered to reduce uncertainty.<br><br>Additionally, our 1,000-square-foot liquid flow calibration room, equipped with SCI/ITAC automated controls and coriolis flow standards, enables precise fuel and water flow calibrations, with fuel flow rates up to 220 GPM and water flow to 10,000 GPM.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
